The structure:

- Talk about the importance of good defaults in Technology
- Introduce the new defaults in Concurrent React and React Hooks
- Introduce a demo Movie app with today's React
- Demonstrate the drawbacks inherent in our current defaults
- Introduce React suspense, live code into the Movie app
- Talk about time slicing and the scheduler API
- Introduce React Hooks, live code into the Movie app
- Talk about Immediate mode vs Retained mode, and the "DX Mullet"
- Conclude by contrasting the current defaults vs the better defaults introduced by the new React APIs

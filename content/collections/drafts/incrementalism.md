I have a love-hate relationship with incrementalism. It comes from far too many meetings exhorting us to go after low hanging fruit, and a lot of work wasted achieving nothing. Often the people who shoot for moonshots experience lower risk than the ambition might merit, but the value of the goal draws supporters and customers. On the other hand, the most successful technologies often aren't the technically best ones. They're the ones that allow incremental adoption.

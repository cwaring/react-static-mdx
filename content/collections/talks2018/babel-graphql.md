description2: Babel-Macros were shipped with Create-React-App v2 - but what are they? What can you do with them? In this lightning talk we discuss how babel macros differ from plugins, and my recent work with babel-blade creating an inline GraphQL compiler that works with all React GraphQL clients.

graphqlasianotes: No technical requirements apart from internet connection. I am the best person to speak on the subject because I made this macro https://babel-blade.netlify.com. Initially it was just a cool toy but then people at Coursera, Netflix, FB, and Adobe have picked up it telling me to keep going so I am applying for a lightning talk so I can spread the idea and get feedback/collaboration with the major clientside GraphQL clients!
